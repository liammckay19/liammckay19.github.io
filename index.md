Let me introduce myself, my name is Liam McKay. Welcome to my world of creativity :) I aim to create this site to capture a glimpse what is going on in my creative journey as of:

January 1st, 2026

I am obsessed with music, technology, and visual art. I am a drummer first but I also play piano, guitar, and bass guitar. 

I have studied drumming in contexts such as: jazz swing (modern big band to 1920s), rock, afro-cuban, brazillian, funk, drum n' bass, and more.

Art that moves or stands still as a canvas, carving, sculpture, or other physical medium moves me as well. I'm also interested in human-made algorithmically generated sounds and non-organized sounds from synths. Music entirely generated with artificial intelligence is just that -- *artificial* music. Living beings (like you and me) are capable of [Musicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Small#Musicking), not computers.

In here you will find a presentation of my:
- [Music]({{ "/music/" | absolute_url }}) projects
- [Coding]({{ "/projects/" | absolute_url }})  projects
- [Video Content]({{ "/videos/" | absolute_url }})  work
- [Visual Art]({{ "/visualart/" | absolute_url }})  work
