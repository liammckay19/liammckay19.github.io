Let me introduce myself, my name is Liam McKay. Welcome to my world of creativity :) I aim to create this site to capture a glimpse what is going on in my creative journey as of:

January 1st, 2026

I am obsessed with music, technology, and visual art. I am a drummer first but I also play piano, guitar, and bass guitar. 

I have studied drumming in contexts such as: jazz swing (modern big band to 1920s), rock, afro-cuban, brazillian, funk, drum n' bass, and more.

Art that moves or stands still as a canvas, carving, sculpture, or other physical medium moves me as well. I'm also interested in human-made algorithmically generated sounds and non-organized sounds from synths. 

In here you will find a presentation of my:
- [Music]({{ "/music/" | absolute_url }}) projects
- [Coding]({{ "/projects/" | absolute_url }})  projects
- [Video Content]({{ "/videos/" | absolute_url }})  work
- [Visual Art]({{ "/visualart/" | absolute_url }})  work

*My current rant*

Music entirely generated with artificial intelligence is just that -- *artificial* music. Living beings (like you and me) are capable of [Musicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Small#Musicking), not computers.

Streaming services are all non-ethical ways to consume music - because they don't give artists a living wage and are unable to because of their buisness model. Spotify did *not democratize* music, and the three big labels (Warner, UMG, Sony) work with Spotify internally to have an unfair advantage for their artists. Software engineers from the 2000s music pirating app Napster were hired by the Spotify CEO Daniel Ek to work on the code for Spotify. Spotify has worked to make the music industry suffer so that they can turn a profit, which has only happened one year since their founding in April 2006 ([The Mood Machine, Liz Pelly](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Mood-Machine/Liz-Pelly/9781668083505)). That is why I have used (for now) Bandcamp to show my music on this site, which gives 80% of the sale to me. This is the same for all artists on the platform. Consider buying it if you want to directly support me and the movement of getting off of streaming platforms. If that isn't enough, in 2025 Spotify's CEO invested millions into AI drone warfare and allowed ICE recruitment ads to play in between songs. If this has moved you to want to change the way you are streaming music, [read more here](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify)

I've become a member of [Subvert](https://subvert.fm/) which is replacing Bandcamp with a democratized online platform where the artists and fans decide how the website itself works, how money is moved, and who the board members are. Bandcamp has been independent until recently, and now they have laid off half of their staff and are at risk of becoming corporatized under their parent company SongTradr.
